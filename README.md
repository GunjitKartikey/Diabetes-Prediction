# Diabetes-Prediction
I successfully developed a diabetes detection model utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM), attaining remarkable accuracy in both training and test datasets. The project involved meticulous data preprocessing, where I conducted comprehensive analysis and applied StandardScaler to ensure consistent feature scaling. Additionally, I demonstrated proficiency in end-to-end model development and deployment by implementing a practical diabetes prediction system. This endeavor showcased my ability to not only construct effective machine learning models but also to seamlessly integrate them into practical applications.
